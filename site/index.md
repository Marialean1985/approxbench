[ApproxBench][gh] is a resource for evaluating *approximate computing* research.

Work in approximate computing studies complex application-level interactions between efficiency and quality. Convincing evaluations need to study applications that are known to error-resilient.

ApproxBench aims to make approximate-computing evaluations easier and better by providing:

* A community-organized selection of **existing benchmarks** selected for their approximability.
* Standard **quality metrics** that take the guesswork out of quantifying precision.
* Initial **program annotations** that can help techniques decide where and how to apply approximations.

The [ApproxBench harnesses][gh] are in development. In the mean time, check out [EnerJ's Java benchmark suite][enerj-apps] and [ACCEPT's C/C++ suite][accept-apps]. You may also be interested in [AxBench from Georgia Tech's ACT Lab][axbench].
